# Team-Tweeten-Project-4

Hi everyone! We are Team Tweeten! Our project goals are to better understand Nigerian food systems, construct food demand and nutrient systems to identify nutritional challenges, and design policies to diminish food insecurity and estimate the costs of those policies. Here are our preliminary notebooks. We will combine them and provide more documentation as we wrap up our project! Thank you!
